					<h3>Harvesting and frying</h3>
					<p>Traditionally coffee is harvested by hand by one of two ways: strip picking or selective picking. Strip picking is exactly how it sounds, trees are harvested entirely at one time "stripping" all the beans off the branches, ripe as well as unripe cherries. Typically, only Robusta coffee is strip picked.</p>

					<h3>Grinding and packing</h3>
					<p>The way you grind your coffee (and when you grind) is the first step toward influencing how the final brew tastes. Believe it or not, you can have the highest quality coffee, the perfect roast, pure water, premium filters, and an excellent coffee maker and still ruin it all with an incorrect grind.</p>

					<h3>True cooking</h3>
					<p>The best way of cooking coffee is coffee machine. T
					 After consulting the chart, I added three tablespoons of medium-grind coffee to the refillable filter basket, chose the regular strength and medium heat, and commenced brewing.</p>

				<h2>Types of coffee</h2>
					<img src="img/robusta.png">
				<p id="texttype">Once roasted, pretty much all coffee beans look the same. But did you know that there are actually dozens of different varieties of coffee beans? When it comes to your daily cup, though, there are really only two that matter: Arabica and robusta. These are the two primary types of coffee cultivated for drinking.
<br>
<br>
What’s the difference between the two? It's significant, and it's helpful to understand when choosing coffee.
<br>
<br>
The two varieties differ in taste, growing conditions, price. Arabica beans tend to have a sweeter, softer taste, with tones of sugar, fruit, and berries. Their acidity is higher, with that winey taste that characterizes coffee with excellent acidity.
<br>
<br>
Robusta, however, has a stronger, harsher taste, with a grain-like overtone and peanutty aftertaste. They contain twice as much caffeine as Arabica beans, and they are generally considered to be of inferior quality compared to Arabica. Some robustas, however, are of high quality and valued especially in espressos for their deep flavor and good crema.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately it’s a question of personal taste. Some all-arabica blends are too high and floral for us; some of the rich, dark harshness of robusta can be a good thing in a blend. Just remember that robusta has twice as much caffeine as arabica, too, when choosing a coffee blend. If you want to skip most of the caffeine, see our tips for choosing decaf coffee for our suggestions on coffee blends and origins.</p>
